**OpenSource with enforcement of peer-to-peer fairness**
========================================================

Still in general fully compliant OpenSource, but not for Trolls.

The following restrictions are added to the assigned base-licenses
as constraints under the following listed conditions by the original
author Arno-Can Uestuensoez Copyright(C) 2007-2016.

As a tribute to the obvious neccesity of the enforcement of 
peer-to-peer fairness the following constraints are included 
in any assigned license to the provided Software. These may in worst 
case withdraw the license from the licensee and the related group 
for lifetime, dating back to the beginning of use - which is 
considered as the public release.

You are free to provide the parts of your own contribution by any
license, as long as the original base remains in literal compliance
to the linked base license(s) including this ammendment. The mandatory
literal compliance of this license add-on in advance of the original 
author must be inherited on the derived conceptual and implementation 
parts into any derived work. 

This is due to the racking financial experience of the original 
author caused by the vast fraud and cheeting after the introduction
of the Multi-Vendor CloudManagement System 'UnifiedSessionsManager'
(C)2008-2016 @Ingenieurbuero Arno-Can Uestuensoez, 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/ctys/
originally published under GPL-3/2008. 

So the license is and remains in case of fairplay open source, else 
is completely withdrawn for all the persons being part and/or related
to the issue. Thus the OpenSource is still the right place to live
for it.

   For recommendations on the commom fraud in conjunction with the
   misuse of skills profiles feel free to refer to: 
   
      http://xkcd.com/1303/

   Ask to arrange a confirmation call within 2-3 business days. If
   they cannot ...for whatever reason..., forward me the evidence 
   please. Record the confirmation call officially and store it 
   please, I officially confirm to record my confirmation call only
   for anyone. I am going to blog each call openly on the internet 
   for your confirmation. I also enumerate each application 
   individually with a UUID, and sign this with a sha256/sha512 hash. 
   These are included in any legal contact, else it is fraud!

   See the full story elsewhere...

The following constraints are part of this license agreement, they 
additionally superpose in any case of inconsistency the terms in the
previous defined licenses with highest priority:

Unfair competition
==================

In case of competition against the author for any bid, permissions 
based on or involved this work are rejected for any work related 
to the bid.

In case unfair competion against the author, including cases not 
known to the author worldwide, this includes the forwarding of 
unauthorized data about the author into any kind of legal, and/or 
illegal network like procurement systems, in the past or from now on,
all license permissions are rejected.

The loss of license comprises all involved parties, including customers,
subcontractors, and competitors as a whole, including chained, shifted, 
and nested ownership, responsibility, and/or involvement.

Balanced duties and rights
==========================

In case of a law suite or any legal action against the author, e.g. 
due to intellectual property, or any other, either direct, or indirect,
any permitted license - to this parties, their subcontractors nested 
to the complete level, and any involved person - is rejected back to
the beginning for concepts and code including derived works.

Invariant Sections
==================

The artefacts contain invariant sections, which comprise the 
information about the original author and the copyright. Changing these 
results in immediate drop of any permission including previous licenses.
This is also the case for any change of any copyright statement from 
any deployment package or copied information.

These sections are marked by the string

  INVARIANT_SECTION_BEG:...
  <project-information-and-data>
  INVARIANT_SECTION_END:...

and could simply be find by common tools.

Software Patents
================

You agree that in particular in the case that any previous constraint 
has to be applied, the author is eventually going to apply his
intellectual property rights arbitrarily and without the requirement of 
any previous notice. Either personally, or by transferring his rights 
to third parties.

Remarks
=======

Any rejection caused by violation of the license conditions could be 
withdrawn personally by the original author(s) written statement 
explicitly only, which requires the proactive disclosure of the whole
issue in an official written and signed statement by the potentially 
violating party.

You have additionally to agree in any commercial issue to proof 
reversal for using this software and related concepts. With using this
software you accept the authors choice of the country and court for 
clearing any leagal issue.
