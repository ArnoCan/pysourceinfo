pysourceinfo
==============

The 'pysourceinfo' package provides basic runtime information on executed 
sourcefiles based on 'inspect' and additional sources.
The covered objects include packages, modules/files and functions/methods/scripts.

For code examples refer to the source package 'pysourceinfo.UseCases'.

setup.py
--------

The installer adds a few options to the standard setuptools options.

* *build_doc*: Creates *Sphinx* based documentation with embeded javadoc-style API documentation by *Epydoc*, html only.

* *build_sphinx*: Creates Sphinx part of the documentation as standalone html. Calls 'callDocSphinx.sh'.

* *build_epydoc*: Creates Epydoc part of the documentation as standalone html.

* *project_doc*: Install a local copy into the doc directory of the project.

* *instal_doc*: Install a local copy of the previously build documents in accordance to PEP-370.

* *test*: Runs PyUnit tests by discovery.

* *usecase*: Runs PyUnit tests on UseCases subdirectory by discovery.


* *--help-pysourceinfo*: Displays this help.

* *--no-install-required*: Suppresses installation dependency checks, requires appropriate PYTHONPATH.

* *--offline*: Sets online dependencies to offline, or ignores online dependencies.

* *--exit*: Exit 'setup.py'.


After successful installation the 'selftest' verifies basic checks by:

  *pysourceinfo --selftest*

with the exit value '0' when OK.

The option '-v' raises the degree of verbosity for inspection

  *pysourceinfo --selftest -v -v -v -v*
