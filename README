pysourceinfo
==============

The 'pysourceinfo' package provides basic runtime information on executed 
sourcefiles based on 'inspect' and additional sources.

The provided feature modules comprise the following list.
For code examples refer to 'pysourceinfo.UseCases'.

setup.py
--------

The installer adds a few options to the standard setuptools options.

* *build_sphinx*: Creates documentation for runtime system by Sphinx, html only. Calls 'callDocSphinx.sh'.

* *build_epydoc*: Creates documentation for runtime system by Epydoc, html only. Calls 'callDocEpydoc.sh'.

* *test*: Runs PyUnit tests by discovery.

* *--help-pysourceinfo*: Displays this help.

* *--no-install-required*: Suppresses installation dependency checks, requires appropriate PYTHONPATH.

* *--offline*: Sets online dependencies to offline, or ignores online dependencies.

* *--exit*: Exit 'setup.py'.

After successful installation the 'selftest' verifies basic checks by:

  *pysourceinfo --selftest*

with the exit value '0' when OK.

The option '-v' raises the degree of verbosity for inspection

  *pysourceinfo --selftest -v -v -v -v*
