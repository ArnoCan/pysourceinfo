ModifiedArtisticLicense2.0
--------------------------

The :ref:`modified Artistic License <MODIFIED_ARTISTIC_LICENSE_20>`
is based on the ArtisticLicense2.0, but
adds the amendmend of "Forced-Fairplay-Constraints" for peer-to-peer fairplay
rules.
The modification is active in the cases:

* breach of the "Forced-Fairplay-Constraints"
* redistribution of the code in order to inherit the license and prevent
  breaches of the "Forced-Fairplay-Constraints" elsewise

The modification restricts, and even revokes the permission including the open source attribution
in case of breaches. 
This is perfectly allright, as you may refer to cases like the faith of Andreas Pavel [AndreasPavel]_,
or even my own - UnifiedSessionsManager (C) 2008 Arno-Can Uestuensoez [UnifiedSessionsManager]_.

It furthermore adds the non-revocable inheritance of the license for each reused part and 
contained parts in derived work, including concepts and 
design. ::

The **ArtisticLicense2.0**: ::
	
	License:ArtisticLicense2.0
	From Free Software Directory
	Name 	Artistic License 2.0
	URL 	http://www.perlfoundation.org/artistic_license_2_0
	
	
	License text
	
	Artistic License 2.0
	
	Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.
	
	Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
	license document, but changing it is not allowed.  Preamble
	
	This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
	Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or
	redistributed. The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some
	artistic control over the development of that Package while still
	keeping the Package available as open source and free software.
	
	You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
	license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the
	terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
	make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
	a different licensing arrangement.  Definitions
	
	"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in
	the copyright notice for the entire Package.
	
	"Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
	material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
	procedures.
	
	"You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute,
	or modify the Package.
	
	"Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
	Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A
	given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a
	Modified Version.
	
	"Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
	accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
	organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
	
	"Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this
	Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It
	does not mean licensing fees.
	
	"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified,
	or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the
	Copyright Holder.
	
	"Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such
	changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.
	
	"Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the
	Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may
	be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
	
	"Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
	configuration files for the Package.
	
	"Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or
	any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation
	of the Source form.  Permission for Use and Modification Without
	Distribution
	
	(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
	Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
	you do not Distribute the Modified Version.  Permissions for
	Redistribution of the Standard Version
	
	(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
	Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
	either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
	all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At
	your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
	Compiled form of the Package.
	
	(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
	modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting
	Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
	will be subject to the Original License.  Distribution of Modified
	Versions of the Package as Source
	
	(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
	or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
	Modified Version) provided that you cleanly document how it differs
	from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
	any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
	you do at least ONE of the following:
	
	(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the
	Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright
	Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.  (b)
	ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the
	user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the
	Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of
	the Standard Version.  (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the
	Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version
	available to others under (i) the Original License or (ii) a license
	that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the
	Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy
	that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the
	Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
	available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are
	allowed.  Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or
	Modified Versions without the Source
	
	(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
	the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
	get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be
	valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any
	time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
	must provide new instructions on demand or cease further
	distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution
	within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are
	invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this
	license.
	
	(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the
	Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the
	Source of the Modified Version.  Aggregating or Linking the Package
	
	(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
	Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
	aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
	Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
	components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
	apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
	as included in the aggregation.
	
	(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
	other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
	build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
	include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
	provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
	Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
	
	(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
	merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
	the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not
	considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
	terms of this license.  General Provisions
	
	(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
	Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
	modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
	use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
	license.
	
	(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version
	made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to
	ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
	this license.
	
	(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
	service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
	
	(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
	free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
	sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
	patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
	infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
	(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
	that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
	infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
	date that such litigation is filed.
	
	(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT
	HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
	WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
	PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT

   **OpenSource with enforcement of peer-to-peer fairness**
   ========================================================
   
   Still in general fully compliant OpenSource, but not for Trolls.
   
   The following restrictions are added to the assigned base-licenses
   as constraints under the following listed conditions by the original
   author Arno-Can Uestuensoez Copyright(C) 2007-2016.
   
   As a tribute to the obvious neccesity of the enforcement of 
   peer-to-peer fairness the following constraints are included 
   in any assigned license to the provided Software. These may in worst 
   case withdraw the license from the licensee and the related group 
   for lifetime, dating back to the beginning of use - which is 
   considered as the public release.
   
   You are free to provide the parts of your own contribution by any
   license, as long as the original base remains in literal compliance
   to the linked base license(s) including this ammendment. The mandatory
   literal compliance of this license add-on in advance of the original 
   author must be inherited on the derived conceptual and implementation 
   parts into any derived work. 
   
   This is due to the racking financial experience of the original 
   author caused by the vast fraud and cheeting after the introduction
   of the Multi-Vendor CloudManagement System 'UnifiedSessionsManager'
   (C)2008-2016 @Ingenieurbuero Arno-Can Uestuensoez, 
   https://sourceforge.net/projects/ctys/
   originally published under GPL-3/2008. 
   
   So the license is and remains in case of fairplay open source, else 
   is completely withdrawn for all the persons being part and/or related
   to the issue. Thus the OpenSource is still the right place to live
   for it.
   
      For recommendations on the commom fraud in conjunction with the
      misuse of skills profiles feel free to refer to: 
      
         http://xkcd.com/1303/
   
      Ask to arrange a confirmation call within 2-3 business days. If
      they cannot ...for whatever reason..., forward me the evidence 
      please. Record the confirmation call officially and store it 
      please, I officially confirm to record my confirmation call only
      for anyone. I am going to blog each call openly on the internet 
      for your confirmation. I also enumerate each application 
      individually with a UUID, and sign this with a sha256/sha512 hash. 
      These are included in any legal contact, else it is fraud!
   
      See the full story elsewhere...
   
   The following constraints are part of this license agreement, they 
   additionally superpose in any case of inconsistency the terms in the
   previous defined licenses with highest priority:
   
   Unfair competition
   ==================
   
   In case of competition against the author for any bid, permissions 
   based on or involved this work are rejected for any work related 
   to the bid.
   
   In case unfair competion against the author, including cases not 
   known to the author worldwide, this includes the forwarding of 
   unauthorized data about the author into any kind of legal, and/or 
   illegal network like procurement systems, in the past or from now on,
   all license permissions are rejected.
   
   The loss of license comprises all involved parties, including customers,
   subcontractors, and competitors as a whole, including chained, shifted, 
   and nested ownership, responsibility, and/or involvement.
   
   Balanced duties and rights
   ==========================
   
   In case of a law suite or any legal action against the author, e.g. 
   due to intellectual property, or any other, either direct, or indirect,
   any permitted license - to this parties, their subcontractors nested 
   to the complete level, and any involved person - is rejected back to
   the beginning for concepts and code including derived works.
   
   Invariant Sections
   ==================
   
   The artefacts contain invariant sections, which comprise the 
   information about the original author and the copyright. Changing these 
   results in immediate drop of any permission including previous licenses.
   This is also the case for any change of any copyright statement from 
   any deployment package or copied information.
   
   These sections are marked by the string
   
     INVARIANT_SECTION_BEG:...
     <project-information-and-data>
     INVARIANT_SECTION_END:...
   
   and could simply be find by common tools.
   
   Software Patents
   ================
   
   You agree that in particular in the case that any previous constraint 
   has to be applied, the author is eventually going to apply his
   intellectual property rights arbitrarily and without the requirement of 
   any previous notice. Either personally, or by transferring his rights 
   to third parties.
   
   Remarks
   =======
   
   Any rejection caused by violation of the license conditions could be 
   withdrawn personally by the original author(s) written statement 
   explicitly only, which requires the proactive disclosure of the whole
   issue in an official written and signed statement by the potentially 
   violating party.
   
   You have additionally to agree in any commercial issue to proof 
   reversal for using this software and related concepts. With using this
   software you accept the authors choice of the country and court for 
   cleaning any leagal issue.
